          will bring in a new crop of health club neophytes as well as bring back seasoned gym-goers who may have taken a
          holiday hiatus. If you’re feeling cramped, don’t worry. By the end of the month, many newbies will have given up from
          not seeing results fast enough, loss of motivation or overdoing it and injuring themselves. However, a few newcomers will
           catch the bug and become permanent fixtures so learning to get along with the cast of characters at the club is key.</a>
