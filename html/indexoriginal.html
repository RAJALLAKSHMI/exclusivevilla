  <p>A villa was originally an ancient Roman upper-class country house.
  Since its origins in the Roman villa, the idea and function of a villa have evolved
  considerably. After the fall of the Roman Republic, villas became small farming compounds,
  which were increasingly fortified in Late Antiquity, sometimes transferred to the
  Church for reuse as a monastery. Then they gradually re-evolved through the Middle Ages into
  elegant upper-class country homes. In modern parlance, 'villa' can refer to various types and sizes
  of residences, ranging from the suburban "semi-detached"
  double villa to residences in the wildland–urban interface.</p>
  <p>In ancient Roman architecture a villa was originally a country house built for the élite.
Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century CE, identified several kinds of villas:
the villa urbana, a country seat that could easily be reached from Rome or another city for a
night or two the villa rustica, the farm-house estate that was permanently occupied by the servants
who had charge generally of the estate, which would centre on the villa itself, perhaps only seasonally occupied.
The Roman villae rusticae at the heart of latifundia were the earliest
 versions of what later and elsewhere became called plantations.</p>

        <p>The Grand Velas is located on a gorgeous white-sand beach off the Cancun - Chetumal road that runs along the Riviera Maya coast.
          There is nothing within walking distance aside from a handful of resorts, but a 15-minute cab ride gets you to dining, shopping,
          and nightlife in Playa del Carmen.
          It used to be the home of the ancient Mayans, and after that a
          small fishing village, but now Playa del Carmen -- or "Playa," as the locals call it --
          is full of exciting nightclubs, popular restaurants, cute boutiques, and resort hotels that sit on lovely
          white-sand beaches. Because many of the businesses are European-run, the rest of the town retains a
           hint of European flair. The main tourist thoroughfare of Playa is the cobblestone-lined, pedestrian street
            Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue), but there are plenty of fun outdoor activities for visitors, too, such as snorkeling,
            scuba diving, kayaking, and sailing. The offshore reef is part of the second largest reef system in the world,
            the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.</p>
